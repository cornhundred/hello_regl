Working through examples from

https://regl.neocities.org/01-hello.html

regl
====

Install regl using npm

  npm install regl

browserify
==========

Use browersify to compile all of your dependencies into a payload of JS that you can deliver in a single script tag

  sudo npm install -g browersify

This will give you a browserify command you can invoke starting from a file, such as main.js and will create a bundle of all the files necessary to run your project =

Start by writing code that requires regl and other libs in main.jg and then you can run browserify to produce bundle.js

  browersify main.js > bundle.js
